# Whac-A-Mole Game

## Player gets points when they click on the square that contains the mole. The mole moves to a random square every 750 milliseconds. The game will continually count down until the timer approaches 0.

### This game is based on a YouTube tutorial from Ania Kubow. I followed the tutorial, and then added a Start and Pause button.
